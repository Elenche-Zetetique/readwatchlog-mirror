class OdsProcessor(BaseProcessor):
	"""
	A class to perform actions on a specially crafted ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) file.

	This class provides functionality to interact with ODS files, extract and process data,
	and interact with the YouTube Data API to retrieve video details. It includes methods for
	handling workbook operations, validating data, and managing outputs.

	Attributes:
		__slots__ (tuple): A tuple of instance variable names to optimize memory usage.

	Methods:
		_check_for_duplicates() -> dict
			Checks for duplicate links in an ODS file and returns their indices.

		__check_record(row) -> bool
			Checks if a worksheet row represents an incomplete or invalid record.

		_convert_to_json() -> dict
			Converts the active worksheet into a JSON-compatible dictionary.

		__find_starting_row() -> int | None
			Finds the starting row containing a valid YouTube link.

		__get_col_number(col_name: str) -> int | None
			Finds the column number for a given column name in the worksheet.

		_get_links() -> dict
			Extracts YouTube links from an Excel worksheet and processes them to store video durations.

		_get_routines() -> dict
			Fetches daily routines from a worksheet as a JSON-structured dictionary.

		_get_tags() -> list[int]
			Extracts column numbers of cells containing 'Tag' in the first row.

		_order_tags() -> None
			Sorts tag values in worksheet rows in ascending order.

		_process_yt_link(link: str, row: int) -> dict
			Processes a YouTube link to extract video details and duration.

		_validate_end_range() -> bool
			Validates that `self._END` is a positive integer greater than `self._START`.

		"""
		Checks for duplicate links in an XLSX file and returns their indices.

		Scans the worksheet starting at row 2, column 2, collecting all link values until an
		empty cell is encountered. Identifies duplicates and maps each duplicate link to a
		list of its zero-based indices in the original sequence.

		Returns:
			dict: Mapping of duplicate links to their indices, e.g., 
				{'link1': [0, 3], 'link2': [1, 5]}. Empty dict if no duplicates found.

		Checks if a worksheet row represents an incomplete or invalid record.

		Examines the specified row in the worksheet (`self._ws`), retrieving values from the 'Duration',

		'Author' is a placeholder ('.') while 'Note' is not a placeholder, indicating an incomplete record.

		Args:
			row (int): The row number in the worksheet to check.

		Returns:
			bool: True if the record is incomplete (has '.' in key fields but not in 'Note'), False otherwise.

		Raises:
			AttributeError: If `self._ws` or `self.__get_col_number` is not initialized.
			ValueError: If `row` is not a valid integer or out of the worksheet's bounds.
			KeyError: If any required column ('Duration', 'Published', 'Author', 'Note') is not found by
					`self.__get_col_number`.

		Notes:
			- Relies on `self._ws` as the worksheet object and `self.__get_col_number` to map column names
			to indices.
			- A '.' value indicates a placeholder or missing data in the respective field.
